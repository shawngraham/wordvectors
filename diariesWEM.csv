at colledge a most charming and beautifull scene is this morning displayed all nature  wears a chearfull garb after so plentifull a shower as we were favoured with the last night receving an additionall lustre from the  sweet influences of the sun  this day i in the religious phylosopher read the following experiment viz  that the filings of iron mixd with sulphur and kneaded to a dough by the addittion of cold water will in a few hours become warm  and at last be set on fire which is undoubtedly true and if so i think that  it affords a very probable method of solving the phnomina of subterraneous fires for it is highly  probable that there are abundance of the particles of iron sulphur and water  which by the flux of water perhaps in the subterraneous caverns may be  brought together and then it appears by the precedent experiment that this  effect viz a fire will be produced at  oclock heard mr winthrops lecture in the hall in which he  was employed in evincing the sphroidall form of the earth which he did from  the vibrations of pendula the precession of the a equinox and from actual  mensuration of degrees at the quinox and the  poles  after which i extracted the following hydrostatical laws from the  religious phylosopher viz st if a body is to  be carried upwards in any liquor an equall bulk of  said liquor must gravitate or weigh more than such a body         ndly  that in order to cause a body to sink in a liquor an equal bulk of said liquor  must weigh less than the body rdly if you would have the body neither to  rise or fall but preserve its place in any part of the liquor an equal  quantity of the said liquor must weigh equally with the body

this morning is beyond description beautyfull  the skie bespangled with clouds which shed a lustre on us by the refraction of the rays of light  together with the healthy and enlivening air which was purifyed by the thunder afford most spirited materials  for contemplation the gaiety of the weather is equally delightfull to the phylosopher poet and the man of pleasure  the phylosopher finds his passions all  calm and serene and pliable so that he finds no difficulty in  subjecting them to the subserviency of his reason he can now contemplate all  the gaudy appearances of nature and like pythagoras bring  phylosophy down from heaven and make her  conversible to men the poet thinks this the best time to converse with his  muse and consequently gives himself up wholly to her directions his whole soul  is at her disposall and he no more retains the  government of himself while the man of pleasure find such delicacys arising from the objects of sence as are adapted to produce the highest sensations of  delight in him       
then mr winthrop began a course of experimental
mr winthrop began a series of  experimental phylosophy and in the st place he  explained to us the meaning nature and excellence of natural  phylosophy which is he says the knowledge of  those laws by which all the bodys in the universe are restrained it being  evident that not only those great masses of matter the heavenly  bodys but all the minutest combinations of matter in each of them are  regulated by the same general laws for instance it is plain that all the  planets observe exactly the same uniform rules in their  revolutions round the sun that every particle of matter observes on the  surface of the earth  as to the usefulness of natural phylosophy to be convinced of that it is necessary  only to reflect on the state of all the civilized nations of  europe compared to many nations in affrica of as quick natural parts as europeans  who live in a manner very little superiour to the  brutes  the first cause and indeed the alpha and omega of natural  phnomena is motion their being an utter impossibility that any effect  should be produced in a natural way without motion and this motion or  rather bodys in motion are subject to the following laws st two bodys of  different velocitys or swiftnesses but aequal masses which motion is  subject to certain laws which he explained and i have forgot but thus much i  remember the that motion produced by gravity was  universally in right lines from the body acted upon by gravity to the center  of gravity as the center of the earth for instance or the like he explained  also powers weights the line of direction of powers and weights the center  of gravity center of         magnitude and center of motion with the  several methods of finding them some of which ive forgot and the rest he  showed us examples of which cant easyly be exhibited  but by reason of some of these laws he tells us there are two famous towers  in  italy the one at  bolognia and the other at  pisa each near an hundred feet high which  are not in a perpendicular position but inclined to the horizon to a certain  degree so as not to have the line of direction fall without the base because  if the line of direction fell not within the base the buildings would  inevitably fall after this and many other things and terms relating to  motion velocity c explained he dismissd us for the first time   he touchd also upon the advantages of gunpowder in war above those of the  battering ram for says he the battering ram was a hugh and unweildy  peice of timber or rather combination of timbers with  an iron head much in the shape of a rams head whence it drew its name  commonly weighing near forty thousand pounds and consequently required a   men to manage it if being a man being scarce able to handle more  than  lb    with velocity enough to do execution now  one of our cannon by the    almost  irresistable force of rarifyed vapour will discharge a   pounder so as to make as large a breach in a wall as the battering ram and  requires but about   or  men to order and direct it therefore   men can do as much execution now with a cannon as  could with a battering  ram and the momenta are equal the velocity of the cannon exceeding         that of the ram as much as the ram exceeds the cannon in weight that  is as  
the second lecture wherein which was wholly taken up in  explaining the propertys of the centers of gravity and motion which were  applyed to the instruments cheifly in use in common life such as the lever  pulley ballance axis in peritrocheo c but  the ballance was chiefly principally  insisted on the reason of it was fully explained and the method of weighing  viz the distances of the bodys from the center of  motion must be precisely in a reciprocall  proportion of their quantitys of matter or  weights always alowing for the weight of the beam  on which they are suspended as well as friction and the falsity of the  supposition that radii proceeding from the center of the earth are  parrellel mr  winthrop also demonstrated to us that all the advantages arising from     any of the engines in use resulted from the  different possion position of them with relation to force  and velocity thence he shew d the famous problem  of archimedes viz to move any weight however great by any  force however small  i had like to have forgot that he applied the doctrines  of the center of gravity to the heavenly bodys  shewing us the affections of the sun and planets  with respect to their centers of gravity and instructed us in the manner of  finding the common center of gravity of any  of em eg earth and moon viz  by this proportion as the quantitys of matter in     both added together is to the quantity of  matter in the one separtely so is the distance of  their centers to the distance of the center of the other from the common  center sought and to find the common center of gravity of   or  or any  given number of bodys having found the common center  of any  from that said center draw a line to another of said  bodys and find the common center of gravity of these  two respecting the         common center of gravity of the former  as a  body containing a quantity of matter equal to both said bodys
the theory of the ballance scales steel  yard  c and all and the  species of levers continued to which  viz the lever he referred allmost all the  instruments in life and    universally to make a quilibrium the product of product  of the quantity of matter in the weight multiplyed into its distance from the center of motion  must be equal to the quantity of matter in the power multiplyed into its distance from said center
the phnomina of the nature of the pulley axis in  peritrochaeo and inclined plane explained which all depend on the laws before  laid down viz that the quantity of matter in the weight bears the same  proportion to the quantity of matter in the power as the distance of the power  from the center of motion to the distance of the weight from said center
the theory of simple machines and in particular of the inclined plane of  the wedge and screw and other machines compounded of these simple ones  finishd
sir isaac newtons three laws of nature proved and  illustrated together with the application of them to the planets which are  kept in their orbits by two forces acting upon them viz that of gravity and  that which is calld its their  centrifugal force whereby it they strives to recede from  the center of their orbits and fly off there from in tangents       
the theory of centrifugal forces continued and aplyed to the cases of the planets and from this  centrifugal force mr winthrop confuted  the hypothesis of vortices from this also arises the spheroidal form of the  earth

if nothing is matter which has not this antiactive principle then human  minds are not matter for they have no such principle we are conscious that we  can begin and end motion of ourselves         if he argues a posteriori  from experiments he can pretend only to probability for unless he was certain  that he had made the experiment and found the property in every particle of  matter that ever was created he could not be certain that there was no  particle in the world without this property tho he  had tried all but one and found that they had it we have tried but a few  parcells of matter the utmost we can say is that all we have tried are  inactive    but for argument sake i will deny that all  the parcels that we have tried have this property on the contrary i will say  that all have a motive power downwards powder has an active power springing  every way c thus experiment is turned against the doctrine i cant yet  see how he will prove all matter anti inactive a priori from properties of  matter before known essential with which he must shew  this to be necessarily connected
read in gilberts tenures i must and will make that book  familiar to me
read in gilbert i read him slowly but i gain ideas and  knowledge as i go along which i dont always when i read
rode to  boston conversed with ned quincy and  saml peter chardon  c by the way peter chardon is a promising youth he aspires and will  reach to a considerable height he has a sense of the dignity and importance of  his profession that of the law he has a just contempt of the idle incurious  pleasure hunting young fellows of the town who pretend to study law he scorns  the character and he aims at a nobler he talks of exulting in an unlimited  field of natural civil and common law talks of nerving sharpening the mind  by the study of law and mathematicks quotes  locks conduct of the understanding and transcribes points of  law into a commonplace book on locks modell this  fellows thoughts are not employed on songs and girls nor his time on flutes  fiddles concerts and card tables he will make something

some voyages we have nothing to do but receive goods on board keep them  safely on the voyage and deliver them safely to the merchant to whom they are  directed but sometimes we make trading voyages we carry a cargo of goods to  sell for money or exchange for other goods in the most profitable manner we  can         here we keep a regular account make the owners debtors for  goods that we buy or receive and give them credit for goods that we deliver  out     this notation was added to the original  manuscript  by charles francis adams who  many of s   entries into other manuscript volumes 
rode to  boston arrived about  after  went into the court house  and sett down by mr paine  att the lawyers table i felt shy under awe and concern  for mr gridley mr prat  mr otis mr  kent and mr thatcher were all present and looked  sour i had no acquaintance with any body but paine and  quincy and they took but little notice however i attended  court steadily all day and at night went to consort with samll  quincy and dr gardiner  there i saw the most spacious and elegant room the gayest company of gentlemen  and the finest row of ladies that ever i saw but the weather was so dull and  i so disordered that i could not make one half the observations that i wanted  to make
i asked his advice about studying greek he answered it is a matter of meer  curiosity  after this long and familiar conversation we went to court  attended all day and in the evening i went to ask mr  thatchers concurrence with the bar drank tea and spent the whole  evening upon original sin origin of evil the plan of the universe and at  last upon law he says he is sorry that he neglected to keep a common place  book when he began to study law and he is half a mind to begin now  thatcher thinks this county is full       
let me remember to mark in my memorandum book the names of the cases and  the terms and points of law that occur in each case to look these terms and  points in the books at otiss prats or any  other office and to digest and write down the whole in the evening at my  lodgings this will be reaping some real advantage by my attendance on the  courts and without this the observations that i may make will lie in total  confusion in my mind

a long obstinate tryal before majr  crosby of the most litigious vexatious suit i think that ever i  heard such disputes    begin with ill humour and scurrilous language and end in a boxing bout or  a law suit

at one of the clock we took our mutton and cyder  under the shade of a fine tree and laid our provisions on a large flat stone  which answered for table dish and plate and then we dined expecting with much  pleasure an easy sail home before the wind which then bread fresh at east  after diner we boarded and hoisted sail and sailed very pleasantly a mile  when the wind died away into a clock calm and left us to row against the tide  and presently against the wind too for that sprung up at south right a head of  us and blew afresh this was hard work doubtful what course to steer whether  to  nut island or to  half moon or to  hangmans island or to  sunken island coll  q grew sick which determined us to go ashore at  hangmans for that was the nearest as soon as he set foot on  shore he vomited very heartily and then weak and faignt and spiritless he  crawled up to the gunning house and wrapping his great coat round him lay  down on the sea weed and slept while i rambled round the island after weeds  and flowers and stones and young gulls and gulls eggs  gulls i suppose  hovered cawing and screaming over the island for fear of their eggs and young  ones all the time we were there when the coll    awoke and found himself strengthened and inspirited we  rowed away under half moon and then hoisted sail and run home so much for  the day of pleasure the fishing frolick the water  frolick we had none of the pleasure of angling very  little of the pleasure of sailing we had much of the fatigue of rowing and  some of the vexation of disappointment however the exercise and the air and  smell of salt water is wholesome

mr otis says there is no limitation of attachments there  is no proportion established between the demand and the quantity to  be attached so that a villain may attach  if he pleases as  security for  and take the whole into the officers custody  tho on second thought this cant be done without  collusion between the plaintiff and the officer for unless the officer is  malicious as well as the plaintiff he will run the risque for the defendant of making a common service and  this is the reason why there has been no mischief made of the unlimited power  of attachment

her intention was to complain against jos ryford and  charge him before the justice with being the father of the bastard child  with which she is now pregnant now what occasion for taking her  examination upon oathby the province law    
the jury gave a verdict for chambers in this case       
this bond has been at least once and an half if not  twice paid the case is this about  years ago the plaintiffs sold a tract  of land containing  acres within such and such  boundaries to one tower for  and he together with the present  defendants became jointly bound to the plaintiffs in  different bonds of  which this is one for the payment of the money but in the time of it a  suspicion arose that those bounds did not include  acres and least they  should not an agreement was made and committed to writing that the land should  be surveyed and if it was found to fall short the deficiency should be  deducted from some of these bonds accordingly the land was afterwards  surveyed and found to fall short  acres and an half which at the  in proportion of to the price of the whole  amounted to about the value of this bond all the other bonds have been  discharged and taken up and this was set against the deficiency of land but  besides all this    at least one half of it has been  paid another way for one of these    obligers carried  the money to hollis and had  of what was due upon every  bond in his hands callculated and paid him down his money and  hollis promised to indorse one half upon every bond that was  left yet this has never been indorsed and  hollis has assurance enough to sue for this whole bond the  defendants have been extreemely careless and  negligent sometimes they paid money abroad and took no receipts but relied  on his honour         to indorse it when he went  home they even left the agreement that obliged him to make up the wanting  land in holliss own hands after the land was surveyed they  left the plan and survey in his hands in short there has been the utmost  simplicity and inattention on their part in every part of all these  transactions and there have not been fewer proofs of artifice secresy and  guile i must say guile on the part of hollis for he always  avoided giving receipts he never would suffer any d person to be present  when he did business they sometimes would carry with them a  neighbour who understood  numbers better than they to calculate for them and see that they were not  injured but whenever they did so hollis would never do any  business with them and at last had the assurance to tell them that he never  would do any business with them if they brought any body with them as long as  he lived so that by one artifice and another we have been led on to pay i  suppose  for  and what is worse than all the rest the deed he  gave is accidentally lost of this hollis got a hint and has  since sold it to another person this hollis has     mortgaged this very land to  mr gouldthwat the clerk of this  court since he found we had lost our deed yet he has the assurance to sue  this bond we have offered him to relinquish his obligation  to make good the deficient land and pay him the  of this bond if he will  execute a new deed of the land but he cant do that he has sold it

dana asked next what number of carters boatmen  shipbuilders c were ever employed at a time at that landing place i  answered half a dozen carters perhaps but my answer should have been this at  some times there are  or  or half a dozen ship carpenters and it is  possible there may have been  or  boats at that wharf at a time which will  require  dozen boatmen and    there has been perhaps   carts in a day with stones and wood and lumber but these carts are coming  and going all day long so that it is a rare thing to see half a dozen carts  there at a time in short there is so much business done there as to         render one tavern necessary but there is not so much business  there is no such concourse of travellers no such multitudes of busy people at  that landing as to need all this cluster of taverns one tavern and one  retailer was thot by the select men quite  sufficient for that place they have appointed one of each and pray that your  honors would    recognize no more
this fine speech was prats yet he is sometimes of opinion  that all these sectaries ought to turn churchmen and that a uniform  establishment ought to take place through the whole nation     i have heard him say that we had better all of us  come into the church than pretend to overturn it c thus it is that fine  speechmakers are sometimes for uniformity sometimes for variety and  toleration they dont speak for the truth or weight but for the smartness  and and novelty singularity of their speech however i heard him  make two observations that pleased me much more one was that     people in years never suppose that young people have  any judgment another was when a deposition was produced taken by  parson wells with a very incorrect caption a caption without  any certificate of mention of the cause in which it was to be used  or certifying that the adverse party was present or notifyed he observed that  the         parson could not take a caption to save his  life and that he knew too much to learn any thing
g says that an indenture for the year   att a certain rent and the lessees continuance in the  house and the lessors permission to continue in the house thro the year  without any new indenture or any  contract or conversation about    any rent is  presumptive evidence that each party intended the rent should continue the  same the lessees continuance in the house without taking the pains of going  to the lessor to treat about new terms is sufficient evidence of his  consent satisfaction with the old terms and of his consent to pay  the old rent and the lessors permission of his tenant to continue in the  house without taking the pains to make a new contract is sufficient evidence  of his satisfaction with the terms and old terms and of his  consent that they should continue       
i do not know nor is it possible for your honours  to determine what reason induced the plantiff to  renounce this suit whether it was the insolvency or whether  because the estate is insolvent or because he had no cause of action or  because his action was mislayed or because his writ was bad which by the way  is very probable considering who drew it that determined the  plantiff not to enter this action i cannot say  and your honours cannot determine it appears to your  honours that the defendant has been vexed and  distressed by this summons that she has been obliged to take a journey to this  town and to attend upon this court where it appears there is nothing for her  to answer to all this appears what motive induced the plantiff to drop his action does not appear and  therefore we have a right to costs as things are circumstanced i will own  that had this action been commenced by any gentleman at this bar i would have  dispensed with this complaint but it was drawn by a petty  fogging deputy sheriff against whom i know it is my duty and i think it is my  interest to take all legall advantages and he himself cannot         think it hard as he has taken both illegal and iniquitous advantages against  me therefore i pray your honours judgment for costs   q if this action should be entered what must be done with it continued  or dismisseda motion must be made for a continuance or a dismission

but it may be said with equal truth that all magistrates and all civil  officers and all civil government is founded and maintained by the sins of  the people all armies would be needless if men were universally virtuous most  manufacturers and tradesmen would be needless nay some of the natural  passions and sentiments of human minds would be needless upon that  supposition resentment eg which has for its object wrong and injury no  man upon that supposition would ever give another a just provocation and no  just resentment could take place without a just provocation thus our natural  resentments are founded on the sins of the people as much as the profession of  the law or that of arms or that of divinity in short vice and folly are so  interwoven in all human affairs that they could not possibly be wholly  separated from them without tearing and rending the whole system of human  nature and state nothing would remain as it is

we accordingly agreed to meet the next evening in one of ballards back  chambers and determine upon times places and studies         we  accordingly met the next evening mr gridley  fitch and i and spent the whole evening proposals were to  read a reign and the statutes of that reign to read hurds dialogues and any new pieces but at last we  determined to read the feudal law and cicero only least we  should loose sight of our main object by attending to too many  thurdsday nights were agreed on and to meet first  at mr gridleys office there we accordingly met on the  thurdsday night following and suffered our  conversation to ramble upon hurds dialogues the pandects their discovery in  italy by lotharius in  in the reign of  stephen upon lambard de priscis anglorum legibus in saxon  and latin upon ld kaims kames  mr blackstone c but we agreed to meet the next  thurdsday night at mr fitchs  and to read the three first titles of the feudal law and tullies oration for  milo

he said further that for himself he felt so happily after his death that  he was pretty sure he had behaved well during his lifetime for himself he was  easy but the poor secretary is infirm it will bear hard upon him and for the  lieutenant governor now the act is repeald and  considering how he has been used instead of doing any  thing to make up his loss to leave him out of council and so to  confirm in the minds of the people a suspicion that he has been an enemy to the  country is very hard for a man who has behaved so well as he has

thus i believe that it appears to all who consider the matter that almost  all the people whether better or worse are of one mind about the governor and  absolutely hate him and despize him  let  phylanthrop say what he will and indeed i have very good reasons to think that  phylanthrop lyed when he said that the better sort had  taken no offence and absolutely endeavoured to  impose a palpable falshood upon the public       
this soliloquy satisfyd me the whole mystery  was unriddled  all phylanthrops facts anecdotes reasonings  vapourings all that he has said done or wrote or  can say do or write is answered at once there is no further occasion for  scribling c nor for me to write any thing  more but the name of    misanthrop

the great question the great questions concerning the right of  juries in the colonies by upon a comparison of the  statutes and  concerning the right of impressing seamen for his majestys service whether  with or without warrants from the lords of the admiralty upon orders of  the king in council are very important and as they  the    of such a pamphlet might suggest alterations  in the statutes and might possibly procure us for the future the benefit of  juries in such cases and the world ought to know at least the american part  of it more than it does of the true foundation of impresses if they have  any       
in short i never saw such an object of admiration reverence contempt and  compassion all at once as this i fear i tremble i mourn for the man and for  his country many others mourne over him with tears in their eyes

this observation was echoed from some tory who applyed it to a late  quotation of the house of representatives it is true richard  d and h  were  weak and worthless princes and their parliaments were bold and resolute but  weak princes may arise hereafter and then there will be need of daring and  determined parliaments the reigns of r  and  h  were the reigns of evil councillors and  favourites and they exhibit notable examples of  the public mischiefs arising from such administrations and of national and  parliamentary vengeance on such wicked minions
stephens the  connecticutt hemp man was at my office with mr  counsellor powell and mr kent  stephens says that the whole  colony of connecticutt has given more implicit observance to a  letter from the select men of  boston than to their bibles for some years and that in  consequence of it the country is vastly happier than it was for every family  has become a little manufactory house and they raise and make within  themselves many things for which they used to run in debt to the merchants  and traders so that no body is hurt but  boston and the maritime towns  i wish there was a tax of s  st on every button from  england it would be vastly for the good of this country  c as to all the bustle and bombast about tea it has been begun by about   doz  hollands tea smugglers who could not find so much profit in  their trade since the nine pence was taken off in  england  thus he some sense and some nonsense       
took an airing in the chaise with my brother sam adams  who returned and dined with me he says he never looked forward in his life  never planned laid a scheme or formed a design of laying up  any thing for himself or others after him i told  him i could not say that of myself if that had been true of me you would  never have seen my face  and i think this was true i was necessitated to  ponder in my youth to consider of ways and means of raising a subsistence  food and rayment and books and money to pay for my education to the bar so  that i must have sunk into total contempt and obscurity if not perished for  want if i had not planned for futurity and it is no damage to a young man to  learn the art of living early if it is at the expence of much musing and pondering and anxiety
this afternoon mr wm frobisher gave me a narration of his  services to the province in introducing the manufacture of pot ashes and pearl  ashes and of his unsuccessfull  petitions         to the general court for a compensation he says he has  suffered in his fortune by his labours and  expences and has been instrumental of introducing  and establishing the manufacture and can obtain nothing that  st worth  of    potashes have been exported from this town yearly  for  years past and more than that quantity for the last two years as appears  by the custom house books and mr sheaff the collector was  his informer that he has invented a method of making potashes in much greater  quantity and better quality than heretofore has been done from the same  materials without any augmentation of expence that  he went to  hingham and worked with mr lincoln a month  and has a certificate from him    to the foregoing  purpose that his new method seperates from the  potash a neutral salt that is very pure and of valuable use in medicine  c and that if his method was adopted no russian potash would sell at any  markett where american was to be had  thus  projectors ever restless

this week has been taken up in the hurry of the court and i have not been  able to snatch a moment to put down any thing the  softly people where i lodge don webb and his wife are the  opposites of every thing great spirited and  enterprizing his father was a dissenting  parson and a relation of mine a zealous puritan and famous preacher this  son however without the least regard to his education his connections  relations reputation or examination into the controversy turns about and goes  to church merely because an handfull of young foolish fellows here took it  into their heads to go don never was or aimed to be any  thing at colledge but a silent hearer of a few  rakes and he continues to this day the same man rather the same softly living  thing that creepeth upon the face of the earth he attempted trade but failed  in that  now keeps school and takes boarders and his wife longs to be  genteel to go to dances assemblies dinners suppers c  but cannot  make it out for want thereof such imbicility of genius such poverty of  spirit such impotence of nerve is often accompanied with a  fribbling affectation of politeness which is to me completely  ridiculous  green tea if we could but get it  madeira wine if i could but  get it  collectors genteel company dances late suppers and  clubbs c c

mr mason led us a jaunt over sharp rocks to the point of  the island opposite to  nantasket where in an hideous cavern formed by a great  prominent rock he shewed us the animal plant or  flower         a small spungy muscular  substance growing fast to the rock in figure and feeling resembling a young  girls breast shooting out at the top of it a flower  which shrinks in and disappears upon touching the substance
yet even this must be understood with certain limitations for there are  times when the cause of religion of government of liberty the interest of  the present age and of posterity render it a necessary duty for a man to make  known his sentiments and intentions boldly and publickly so that it is difficult to establish any  certain rule to determine what things a man may and what he may not lawfully  conceal and when but it is no doubt clear that there are many things which  may lawfully be concealed from many persons at certain times and on the other  hand there are things which at certain times it becomes mean and selfish  base and wicked to conceal from some persons       
these gentlemen are all valetudinarians and are taking the northern tour for  their health

this mettlesome barrister gives us the best account of the unanimity of the  kings bench that i have ever heard or read  according to him it is not uncommon abilities     integrity and temper as mr burrows would perswade us but sheer fear of lord md  mansfield the scottish chief which produces         this miracle in the moral and intellectual world  ie of   judges agreeing perfectly in every rule order and judgment for  years  together  men never agreed so perfectly in sentiment for so long a time  before  clocks never struck together a thousandth part of the time  minds  never thought reasoned and judged alike before for a ten thousandth  part

this evening at the bar meeting i asked and obtained the unanimous consent  of the bar to take mr elisha thayer of  braintree son of captn ebenr thayer jur as a clerk how few  years are gone since this gentleman was pleased to call me a petty  lawyer at majr crosbys court now  he is soliciting me to take his son and complementing  c         may    me  with being the first lawyer in the province as he did in express words  tho it was but a compliment and if sincere in him  was not true but a gross mistake nay what is more remarkable still  complimenting me with his seat in the house of representatives as he did by  assuring me in words that if i had an inclination to come from  braintree he would not stand in my way  such are the  mistakes we are apt to make in the characters of men and in our conjectures of  their future fortune this however is a wretched tryumph a poor victory a small antagonist to defeat   and i have very few of this kind of conquests to boast of the governor tells  of a vast no of these changes in sentiment  concerning him  and will be able to tell of many more
these are the insults that i have exposed myself to by a very small and  feeble exertion for s adams to be register of deeds thus are  the friends of the people after such dangerous efforts and such successful  ones too left in the lurch even by the people themselves i have acted my  sentiments with the utmost frankness at hazard of all and the certain loss  of ten times more than it is in the power of the people to give me for the  sake of the people and now i reap nothing but insult ridicule and contempt  for it even from many of the people themselves however i have not hitherto  regarded consequences to myself i have very chearfully sacrificed my interest and my health and  ease and pleasure in the service of the people i have stood by their friends  longer than they would stand by them i have stood by the people much longer  than they would stand by themselves but i have learnd wisdom by experience i shall certainly become  more retired and cautious i shall certainly mind my own farm and my own  office       
he is a singular man it will be amusing to observe his behaviour upon his return to active life in the senate  and at the bar and the influence of his presence upon the public councils of  this province i was an hour with him this morning at his office and there he  was off his guard and reserve with me i find his sentiments are not altered  and his passions are not eradicated the fervour of  his spirit is not abated nor the irritability of his nerves lessened       
this day arrived hall from  london with news of the committment of the mayor and mr  alderman oliver to the tower by the house of commons i read this  morning in the english papers and the political register for april all the  proceedings against the printers thompson and  wheble and vs  the mayor and alderman wilks and  oliver what the consequence will be of these movements it  is not easy to foresee or conjecture a struggle a battle so serious and  determined between two such bodies as the house and the city must produce  confusion and carnage without the most delicate management on both sides or  the most uncommon concurrence of accidents       
dr cooper mentioned an old proverb that an  ounce of mother wit is worth a pound of clergy mr otis mentioned another which he said conveyed  the same sentiment  an ounce of prudence is worth a pound of wit     this produced a dispute and the sense of the company  was that the word wit in the d proverb meant the  faculty of suddenly raising pleasant pictures in the fancy but that the phrase         mother wit in the first proverb meant natural parts and clergy  acquired learning  book learning dr cooper  quoted another proverb from his negro glasgow  a mouse can  build an house without timble  and then told us another instance of  glasgows intellect of which i had before thought him entirely  destitute the dr was speaking to  glasgow about adams fall and the introduction  of natural and moral evil into the world and glasgow said  they had in his country a different account of this matter the tradition was  that a dog and a toad were to run a race and if the dog reached the goal  first the world was to continue innocent and happy but if the toad should  outstrip the dog the world was to become sinfull and miserable  every body thought there could be no danger but  in the midst of the career the dog found a bone by the way and stopped to knaw  it and while he was interrupted by his bone the toad constant in his  malevolence hopped on    reached the mark and spoiled  the world

general election went to  boston and to  cambridge and returned to  boston at night

a fair soft pleasant morning  i believe the peasants round about the  town of boston are as contracted in their views and notions as  any people in the province on the north side of  charlestown ferry their lands are divided into little strips  and they spend the whole year in providing for a few cows and in carrying their  milk in bottles over the ferry and wheeling it about the  town of boston on the south side of the neck they raise garden  stuff and hay for the market but they have less conversation with travellers  and         strangers and therefore less civility knowledge c     than countrymen at a greater distance   turned out my horse at coll  williamss  marlborough dined at martins  northborough where i met with my class mate  wheeler of  george town the episcopal priest he says the deer in  st jamess park are as tame as catts  they will come up to you and eat any thing out of  your hands there is a large number of them in the park and it is a rare thing  to have one of them stolen or killd it is  transportation to do either so there is a number of swans upon  the thames none of em get killed nor any of their eggs  destroyed mr wheeler informed me that coll lithgow of  george town had a son which he designed to get me to take he  is  years of age has studied latin with mr wheeler but  has never been at colledge c he gives a  pitifull account of our classmate his brother bayley  bailey and his wife their want of ceconomy  and their wretched jig c  oated and drank tea at  furnaces lodged at mr  putnams in  worcester

rode with mr barrell to  ipswich and put up at  treadwells every object recalls the subject of grief  barrell all the way to  ipswich was like the turtle bemoaning the loss of his mate  fine season and beautifull scenes but they did not charm him as they  used to he had often rode this way a courting with infinite pleasure  c  i cant reallize that she has  left me forever when she was well i often thought i could reallize the loss of her but i was mistaken i had no  idea of it  in short this mans mournings have melted and softened me  beyond measure       
i went this evening spent an hour and took a pipe with judge  trowbridge at his lodgings he says  you will never get your health till your mind is at  ease if you tire yourself with business but especially with  politicks you wont get well i said i dont  meddle with politicks nor think about em  except says he by writing in the papers  ile be sworn says i i have not wrote one line in a  newspaper these two years c  the judge says he had an hint that  foster         hutchinson was appointed judge because  of the judgment of the court in the case of spear vs keen the merchants took the alarm and said that  instead of lawyers they ought to have merchants upon the bench and  mr hutchinson being both a lawyer and  a merchant he was the man vs the governors  determination a little time before  but this is one instance among  of  the governors disguise before those that he induces to believe has his entire  familiarity and confidence he made mr goffe understand he  intended to make worthington or some other lawyer a judge  when he fully designed to make his brother not indeed to please the merchants  or because foster was a merchant but  because he was his brother and that the family might have a majority in that  court he is impenetrable to those who dont desire to reach any imperfection in  him and who are determined not to fathom him where they may the bigotted  the superstitious the enthusiastical the tools the interested the timid  are all dazzled with his glare and cant see clearly when he is in the  horizon

yesterday i had a good deal of conversation with judge  trowbridge he seems alarmed about the powers of the court of probate  he says if judge danforth was to die tomorrow and the  governor was to offer that place to him he would not take it because he  thinks it ought always to be given to some judge of the inferiour court and then some one lawyer might be found  in each county who would take a seat upon the inferiour bench if he could be made a judge of probate  at the same time he says he is utterly against foster  hutchinsons holding the probate office in  boston if he takes his place upon the superior bench  and if  the governor is an integral part of the court of probate the supreme  ordinary ie if he is not with the members of the council only primus inter  pares but has a negative upon all their decrees as governor  shirley govr bernard and the late secretary were  of opinion he thinks we may be         in great danger from the court of  probate and judge russell always opposed every attempt to  extend the power of the court of probate  he used to say we might have  bishops here and the court of probate might get into their hands and  therefore we ought to be upon our guard

the manners of  maryland are somewhat peculiar they have but few merchants  they are chiefly planters and farmers the planters are those who raise tobacco  and the farmers such as raise wheat c the lands are cultivated and all  sorts of trades are exercised by negroes or by transported convicts which has  occasioned the planters and farmers to assume the title of gentlemen and they  hold their negroes and convicts that is all labouring people and tradesmen in such contempt that  they think themselves a distinct order of beings hence they never will suffer  their sons to labour or learn any trade but they  bring them up in idleness or what is worse in horse racing cock fighting and  card playing       
the object of the men of property here the planters c is  universally wealth every way in the world is sought to get and save money  landjobbers  speculators in land     little  generosity to the public  little public spirit

yesterday the captn brought in a curiosity which  he had drawn up over the side in a buckett of water  which the sailors call a portuguese man of war and to  day i have seen many of them sailing by the ship they have some  appearances of life and sensibility they spread a curious sail and are wafted  along very briskly they have something like gutts  hanging down which are said to be in a degree poisonous to human flesh the  hulk is like blue glass i pierced it with the sharp point of my pen knife and  found it empty the air came out and the thing shrunk up almost to  nothing       
what is this gulph stream what is the course of it  from what point and to what point does it flow how broad is it how far  distant is it from the  continent of america what is the longitude and latitude of  it       
i hope for the future we shall carry less sail especially of nights and at  all times when we are not in chase
this evening the wind is very fresh and the ship sails at a great rate we  are out of the reach i hope of the gulph stream and of  british cruizers two evils which i have a great  aversion to

no says the cat i wont let go and fall you shall stoop and set me  down
oswald talks of pultney and a plott to divide  america between  france and england  france to have  n england they tell a story about vergennes and his agreeing that the english might propose  such a division but reserving a right to deny it all these whispers ought not  to be credited by us

the marquis said that he believed the  reason why c de vergennes said so little about  the progress of mr fitsherbert with him was because the  difficulty about peace was made by the spaniards and he was afraid of making  the americans still more angry with  spain he knew the american were  very  angry with the spaniards
thank you for your good will says i which i feel to be sincere but nations  dont feel as you and i do and your nation when it gets a little refreshed from  the fatigues of the war when men and money are become plenty and allies at  hand will not feel as it does now we never can be such damned sots says he as  to think of differing again with you  why says i in truth i have never been  able to comprehend the reason why you ever thought of differing with us       
if the britons should strike with us i would agree with you         after the terms are signed to advise to the measure if i were  the king of g britain i would give orders to all my  ambassadors at the neutral courts to announce to those courts the independence  of  america that i had acknowledged it and given a commission  under the great seal to treat with the ministers of the  united states of america that i recommended to these courts to  follow the example and open negotiations with the said  united states that i recommended to those  neutral states to send their vessells  freely to and receive vessells freely from all the  ports of the  united states i would send the earl of  effingham ambassador to congress instructed to assure them that i  would no do them my best offices to secure to them the  fisheries their extent to  the missisippi and the navigation of that river that i  would favour all their negotiations  in europe upon their own plan of making commercial treaties with  all nations that i would interpose my good offices with the barbary states to  procure them mediterranean passes c

i have not attempted in these notes to do justice to the arguments of my  colleagues both all of whom were throughout the whole  business when they attended very attentive and very able especially  mr jays to whom the french would if  they knew as much of his negotiations as they do of mine would very justly  give the title with which they have inconsiderately decorated me that of le  washington de la negotiation a very flattering compliment indeed to which i  have not a right but sincerely think it belongs to mr  jay        
made many visits c

i hope it will be permitted to me or to some other who can do it better some  ten or fifteen years hence to collect together in one view my little  negotiations in  europe fifty years hence it may be published perhaps  i  will venture to say however feebly i may have acted my  part or however whatever mistakes i may have committed yet  the situations i have been in between angry nations and more angry actions  have been some of the most singular and interesting that ever happened to any  man the fury of ennemies as well as of  elements the subtilty and arrogance of  allies and what has been worse than all the jealousy envy and little pranks  of friends and copatriots would form one of the most instructive lessons in  morals and politicks that ever was committed to  paper

i told him the story of my correspondence with the c de  vergennes in  about communicating my mission to lord  g germain he said if i had followed my own opinion and written  to his lordship and published the letter it would have turned out the old  ministry i told him i was restrained by a requisition from the king besides  the defeat of destaing and langara had  turned the heads of the people of  england at that time       
i have been injured and my country has joined in the injury it has basely  prostituted its own honour by sacrificing mine but  the sacrifice of me for my virtues was not so servile and intollerable as putting us all under guardianship  congress surrendered their own sovereignty into the hands of a french minister  blush blush ye guilty records blush and perish it is glory to have broken  such infamous orders infamous i say for so they will be to all posterity how  can such a stain be washed out can we cast a veil over it and forget it       
f franklin this morning  mentioned to me the voyage de la fonte who mentions a captain  chapley and a seymour gibbons f thinks it is  translated from the spanish and that the translator or printer has  put seymour for seignor he had once a correspondence about  this voyage and mr prince found there had been  a captain chapelet at  charlestown and a gibbons but not  named seymour
he mentions a new sort of bark much redder and much stronger than any  known before
spent the evening in company with the abby de mably some  other abbys and accademicians         de mably says there are in  france three orders of citizens the first order is of the  clergy  the second of the nobility  and the third is called le tiers  etat  there are several classes in the order of the clergy  or  classes  in the order of nobles and thirty classes in the tiers etat the nobles all  believe that their nobility is from god and therefore the nobles are all  equal and that the king cannot confer nobility
with regard to the fifth that respecting the loyalists it would produce  much evil it would         it would totally defeat the recommendations  which congress were pledged to make in favour of the  loyalists and put them in a worse predicament than that they already stood in  by the treaty in order to support this assertion mr townsend  reasoned a good deal on the great danger arising at all times from creating  jealousies and suspicions in parties negotiating but if there was any party  more prone to jealousy any state more liable to catch suspicion sooner than  another it must be the  united states of america on account of their having been little  accustomed to the business of negotiating and being obliged to trust  their first and dearest interests in the hands of persons of whose fidelity  they had scarcely any pledge o f security mr  townsend concluded with saying that for these reasons he should  resist the fifth resolution as well as the fourth
chatelux said to the abby morlaix  that i was the author of the  massachusetts constitution and that it was the best of em all  and that the people were very contented with it

we drew together a proposition for withdrawing the troops opening the  ports and quieting the tories and went with it in my carriage to mr  laurens who thought it might do i said to my brothers i shall be  very ductile about commerce i would agree at once to a mutual naturalization  or to the article as first agreed on by dr f and  mr jay with mr  oswald or i would agree to mr hartleys propositions  to let the trade go on as before the war or as with nova scotia  i could agree to any of these things because that time and the natural course  of things will produce a good treaty of commerce  gb will soon see and feel the         necessity of  alluring american commerce to her ports by facilities and encouragements of  every kind we called at mr hartleys  hotel de york he was out at mr  jays mr hartley came in we told him we thought of  making him a proposition tomorrow and would meet him at mr  laurenss at one wrote to dr franklin and  w t franklin desiring their attendance at mr  laurenss  hotel de lempereur at  tomorrow received an answer that  they would attend mr hartley desired of me letters of  introduction for il comte di ferm a cousin of  the neapolitan ambassader in london who is going to  america which i promised him and wrote in the evening

and reciprocally all rivers harbours lakes  ports and places under the dominion of his britannic majesty shall  thenceforth be open and free to the merchants and trading vessells of the said  united states and of each and every of them who shall be  received treated
he said his commission would come as soon as the courier could go and  return and that he would prepare his propositions for the definitive treaty  immediately he said he had not imagined that we had been so  stout as he found us  but he was very silent and attentive  he has had hints i suppose from laurens and jay and franklin too he never  before discovered a capacity to hearken he ever  before took all the talk to himself i am not fond of talking but i wanted to  convey into his mind a few things for him to think upon none of the english  gentlemen have come here apprized of the place  where their danger lay       
i told him he and i were in the same case and explained to him my situation  and gave him my frank sentiments of a certain minister he said he was  veritablement touch
in truth congress and their ministers have been plaid upon like children trifled with imposed upon  deceived franklins servility and insidious  faithless selfishness is the true and only cause why this game has succeeded  he has aided vergennes with all his weight and  his great reputation in both worlds has supported this ignominious system and  blasted every man and every effort to shake it off i only have had a little  success against him

the sardinian ambassador said to me it was curious to remark the progress  of commerce the furs which the hudsons bay company sent to  london from the most northern regions of america were sent to  siberia within  leagues of the place where they were hunted  he began to speak of la fontes voyage and of the  boston story of seymour or seinior gibbons but other company  came in and interrupted the conversation
the duke said it would be very difficult to regulate  this matter they could not let us bring their sugars to  europe neither to  france nor any other part this would lessen the number of  french ships and seamen but he thought we should be allowed to purchase sugars  for our own consumption how they will estimate the quantity and prevent our  exceeding it i know not he said there were provinces in  france as  guienne and  provence which depended much upon supplying their islands with  provisions as wheat and flour c i asked him if we should be allowed to  import into their islands wheat flour horses live stock lumber of all  sorts salt fish c he said it would be bien difficile for wheat and flour  c

we are at osbornes adelphi hotel i am obliged here to give thirteen  shillings a day for a parler a bed chamber and  another bed chamber over it for my son without any dining room or antichamber  this is dearer than my lodgings at the hotel du roi in  paris  half a guinea for my bed chamber and parlour and half a crown for my sons bed chamber my  servants lodging is included in the half guinea the rooms and furniture are  more to my taste than in  paris because they are more like what i have been used to in  america

in the common experiment with which boys amuse them  selves the air which         is blown through the tobacco pipe into  the soap suds is common air of equal weight with that which surrounds the  bubble and therefore will not ascend very high but if inflammable air were  blown thro the pipe instead of common air we should  have a series of ballons aerostatiques which would ascend like those of  montgolphier

as he went out he took me aside and whispered that altho he would not serve a foreign prince he would serve  a republick and although he should hurt himself  with the queen and her party to a great degree yet if the states general would  invite him without his soliciting or appearing to desire it he would accept  the command mailbois loved money and demanded splendid  appointments he did not regard money so much and would be easy about that i  was the first mortal to whom he had suggested the idea he wished i would think  of it and he would call and see me again in a few days       
we came to no resolution but that i should go tomorrow to  versailles and ask the advice of  the c comte de  v vergennes  dr f being  confined by his stone could not go and mr jefferson being  worse with his disorder cannot go i was for writing a letter to the c  but  my colleagues were not  f and j are confident that england has no right to  appoint a consul without a treaty or convention for that purpose i think  they have a right by the law of nations       
he asked if we had written to congress and obtained their instructions i  told him we had received full powers to treat with  morocco  algiers  tunistripoli and all the rest and had written  for instructions upon the article of money and presents he said that there was  a frequent communication between  marseilles and the  coast of barbary but that as these things were not in his  department we must state our desires in writing which i agreed to do i asked  him if he thought it adviseable for us to send any one to  morro morrocco he said yes but as we could neither go nor  were authorized to substitute we should write to the emperor untill congress could send a consull i asked what he thought of our leaving it by our  letter in the option of the emperor to send a minister here to treat with us  or to wait untill we could write to congress and  recommend to them to send him a consull he said by  no means for the expence of receiving his minister  here would be much greater for we must maintain him and pay all his  expences he said that the king of  france never sent them any naval stores he sent them  glaces and other things of rich value but never any  military stores       
one of the foreign ambassadors said to me you have been often in  england  never but once in november and december you  have relations in  england no doubt  none at all  none how can that be you  are of english extraction  neither my father or mother grandfather or  grandmother great grandfather or great grandmother nor any other relation that  i know of or care a farthing for have been in  england these  years so that you see i have not one drop of  blood in my veins but what is american  ay we have seen says he proofs  enough of that this flattered me no doubt and i was vain enough to be pleased  with it

heard dr priestley at mr linseys in  essex street
viewed the british musaeum dr  grey who attended us spoke very slightly of buffon said he was full  of mauvais fois no dependence upon him three out of four of his quotations  not to be found that he had been obliged to make it his business to examine  the quotations that he had not found a quarter of them that linnxus was  quoted from early editions long after the last edition was public of  the  th which was inexcuseable he did not think buffon superiour to dr hill both had  imagination c  this is partly national prejudice and malignity no  doubt       
on saturday night returned from a tour to  portsmouth in which we viewed paines hill in  surry as we went out and  windsor as we returned we were absent four days paines hill is  the most striking piece of art that i have yet seen the soil is an heap of  sand and the situation is nothing extraordinary it is a new creation  of mr hamilton all made within   years it belongs to mr hopkins who rides by it but never  stops the owners of these enchanting seats are very indifferent to their  beauties  the country from  guilford to  portsmouth is a barren heath a dreary waste       
copleys fall of chatham or pierson wests wolf  epaminondas bayard c trumbulls warren and montgomery are interesting  subjects and useful but a million pictures of flours game cities landscapes with whatever industry  and skill executed would be seen with much indifference the sky the earth  hills and valleys rivers and oceans forrests  and groves towns and cities may be seen at any time

lime dissolves all vegetable substances such as leaves straws stalks  weeds and converts them into an immediate food for vegetables it kills the  eggs of worms and seeds of weeds the best method is to spread it in your barn  yard among the straw and dung it succeeds well when spread upon the ground  burning lime stones or shells diminishes their weight but slaking the lime  restores that weight the german farmers say that lime makes the father rich  but the grandson poor  ie exhausts the land this is all from mr  rutherford plaister of paris has a  vitriolic acid in it which attracts the water from the air and operates like  watering plants it is good for corn  not useful in wet land you sprinkle it  by hand as you sow barley over the ground  bushells powdered to an    acre  carry it in a bag as you would grain to sow       
mr meredith at mr vaughans explained to  me his method he takes a first crop of clover early then breaks up the  ground cross ploughs and harrows it then plants potatoes he only ploughs a  furrow drops the potatoes a foot a sunder and then covers them with another  furrow he ploughs now and then between these rows but never hoes as soon as  the season comes for sowing his winter barley he diggs  the potatoes ploughs and harrows the ground sows the winter barley with  clover seeds and orchard grass seeds and the next spring he has a great crop  of barley and afterwards a great burthen of grass   he prefers orchard grass to herds grass as much more productive

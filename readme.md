# wordvectors

- exploring Ben Schmidt's word vectors package, discussed here: http://bookworm.benschmidt.org/posts/2015-10-25-Word-Embeddings.html and original github repo here: https://github.com/bmschmidt/wordVectors

- go to his ['QuickStart'](https://github.com/bmschmidt/wordVectors#quick-start) to get things installed.

- feel free to try this out on my scraped copy of John Adams Diaries, which comes originally from [the Massachusetts Historical Society website](https://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/archive/diary/)

- my script is [here](WEM.R) and should help you get going too.

- some of my output is in the [imgs](/imgs) folder.
